# Lambda Serverless with Node.js and TypeScript on AWS

This repository contains a serverless application built with Node.js, TypeScript, and deployed on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework. This project serves as a template or starter kit for building and deploying serverless applications on AWS.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes the power of AWS Lambda to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **AWS Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with various AWS services such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.
- **Scalability**: Built-in scalability with AWS Lambda allows handling any workload size automatically.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy with a single command using the Serverless Framework.

## Prerequisites
